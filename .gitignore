# Node Dependencies. Node_modules contains all npm-dependent files related to the Angular APP
# It is large (several hundred MB), and with the npm install command, execution can be generated automatically 
# You don't store several dependent datasets on GitHub
# but only package.json and package-lock.json so that they are reproduceable 

 node_modules/

# Angular Build Output. This is generated after the execution of the ng build command
# This contains code generated from the source code after the build command
# This can be generated after every build command, hence need not be stored in the repository

dist/

# Terraform files
# .tfstate and .tfstate.backup contain the current status of your infrastructure

*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup

# .terraform contains Terraform-Plugins and Module-Downloads
# These data are machine dependent and often sensitive (for ex:, it can contain login details)
# In teams or during CI/CD, it is better to save it remotely (for ex:- S3 with locking) but never in Git

.terraform/

# IDE and System Files

# .vscode stores personalized editor settings that can vary with every developer
.vscode/

# .DS_Store is macOS system data for directory representation - irrelevant for this project
.DS_Store

# .log contains temporary protocol details (for ex: from Node.js, TerraForm or npm), not relevant for code versions
*.log
